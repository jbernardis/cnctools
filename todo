allow for lowest layer to leave some material behind

set material thickness/depth of cut, safez, decimal places globally

verify y offset values for tichy arc top windows (can't really do unless I have windows in hand)

show image of tichy parts when chosen

either complete implementation of blind faces in box, or remove feature

box generate gcode - get values from settings/tools/materials depth, measuring system, safez, etc

figure out how to deal with tool dimensions in metric vs imperial 

polyline - initial value for points



	carve: grid, hatch, diamond
	contour: line, arc, circle, polygon, rectangle, rounded slot, polyline
	drills: circle, linear, rectangle
	objects: tichy, box
