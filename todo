verify y offset values for tichy arc top windows (can't really do unless I have windows in hand)

show image of tichy parts when chosen

either complete implementation of blind faces in box, or remove feature

polyline - initial value for points


rectangle - rounded corners

verify plotting of imperial g code - scale may not be right

look into when to NOT use a tool name - it tool is metric and object is imperial or vice versa, it will never report the tool name (except in box because of a different bug)
